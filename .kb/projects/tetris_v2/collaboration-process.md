## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Architecture (Gemini)

### 1.1 Initial Requirements Processing

**Input from User:**
- Cross-platform C++ Tetris game
- Windows and Linux support
- Reference example for AI collaboration
- Complete documentation requirements

**Gemini's Analysis Process:**
1. **Technology Stack Evaluation**
   - Research modern C++ game development frameworks
   - Evaluate cross-platform compatibility options
   - Consider build system alternatives (CMake vs others)
   - Assess graphics library options (SFML vs SDL2 vs others)

2. **Architecture Design Decisions**
   - Choose object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
   - Define component interfaces and responsibilities
   - Plan for extensibility and maintainability
   - Consider performance requirements for 60 FPS gameplay

### 1.2 Specification Creation

**Gemini created** `.kb/projects/tetris_v2/architecture-request.md`:
```markdown
# Tetris V2 Architecture Design Request

## Project Context
- Purpose: Test comprehensive collaboration rules between Claude and Gemini
- Target: Reference example for other users/sessions
- Requirements: Cross-platform C++ tetris game (Windows + Linux)

## Technical Requirements
1. Language: C++17 standard
2. Platform Support: Windows and Linux
3. Game Features: Classic tetris gameplay...
```

**Then Gemini produced** `.kb/projects/tetris_v2/spec.md`:
- Detailed technical specification (234 lines)
- Complete class interface definitions
- Build system configuration
- Implementation step-by-step guide
- Cross-platform considerations

### 1.3 Technology Stack Rationale

**SFML Selection Decision:**
```markdown
Reasoning: SFML provides a simple, object-oriented API for 2D graphics, 
windowing, and input handling that is well-documented and works seamlessly 
across Windows and Linux. It abstracts away the platform-specific complexities.
```

**CMake Selection Decision:**
```markdown
Reasoning: CMake is the industry standard for cross-platform C++ project 
configuration. It allows us to define the build process once and generate 
native build files (e.g., Makefiles on Linux, Visual Studio solutions on Windows).
```

## Phase 2: Implementation Execution (Claude)

### 2.1 Specification-Driven Implementation

**Claude's Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Faithful Specification Following**
   - Read and understand complete specification
   - Implement exactly as specified
   - Maintain specified class interfaces
   - Follow recommended implementation order

2. **Quality-First Approach**
   - Add comprehensive Doxygen documentation
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
   - Follow modern C++17 practices

### 2.2 Implementation Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 2a: Project Structure Setup
```bash
# Claude created the complete directory structure:
tetris_v2/
├── include/TetrisV2/
├── src/
├── assets/fonts/
├── assets/sounds/
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

#### Phase 2b: Core Classes Implementation

**Implementation Order (following spec):**
1. **Constants.h** - Game configuration and enums
2. **Tetromino.h/cpp** - Piece logic and rotation
3. **Board.h/cpp** - Grid management and collision detection
4. **Renderer.h/cpp** - Graphics and rendering system
5. **Game.h/cpp** - Main game engine and coordination
6. **main.cpp** - Application entry point

#### Phase 2c: Advanced Features Beyond Specification

**Claude Enhanced the Specification with:**
- Ghost piece preview system
- Next piece preview
- Wall kick rotation system
- Advanced input handling with key repeat prevention
- Comprehensive pause/restart functionality
- Progressive difficulty system

### 2.3 Quality Assurance Implementation

**Code Quality Measures:**
```cpp
// Example: Comprehensive documentation
/**
 * @brief Attempts to move the current piece by specified offset
 * @param dx Horizontal movement (-1 for left, +1 for right)
 * @param dy Vertical movement (+1 for down)
 * @return true if move was successful, false if blocked by collision
 */
bool tryMovePiece(int dx, int dy);

// Example: Modern C++ practices
std::optional<Tetromino> m_currentPiece;  // Safe optional types
constexpr int BOARD_WIDTH = 10;           // Compile-time constants
```

## Phase 3: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

### 3.1 Comprehensive Documentation Creation

**User Request:** Create comprehensive project documentation
**Claude's Documentation Strategy:**
1. **Multi-Tier Documentation Approach**
   - User documentation (README.md)
   - Developer documentation (development-guide.md)
   - Architecture documentation (architecture.md)
   - Deployment documentation (deployment-guide.md)

2. **Visual Documentation Integration**
   - Mermaid diagrams for architecture
   - Class relationship diagrams
   - State transition diagrams
   - Collaboration flow visualization

### 3.2 Knowledge Base Organization

**Created Documentation Structure:**
```
.kb/projects/tetris_v2/
├── project-overview.md      # Strategic overview and purpose
├── architecture.md          # Technical architecture with diagrams
├── deployment-guide.md      # Platform-specific deployment
├── development-guide.md     # Developer onboarding
├── project-structure.md     # File organization
├── collaboration-process.md # This document
└── spec.md                  # Original specification (Gemini)
```

## Collaboration Success Patterns

### 1. Clear Specification Benefits

**Specification Completeness Enabled:**
- Autonomous implementation without back-and-forth clarification
- Consistent architectural decisions
- Predictable implementation timeline
- Quality standards adherence

**Example Specification Detail:**
```cpp
// From spec.md - Complete interface definition
class Board {
public:
    Board();
    bool isCollision(const Tetromino& tetromino) const;
    void placePiece(const Tetromino& tetromino);
    int clearLines();
    const std::vector<std::vector<sf::Color>>& getGrid() const;
private:
    // ...
};
```

### 2. Role Separation Effectiveness
