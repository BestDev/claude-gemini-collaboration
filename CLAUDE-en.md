# Claude Code Collaboration Protocol - Claude-Led Execution Model

## Core Principles

### 🎯 Claude-Led Session (Default Mode)
**Current Situation**: All sessions where users directly communicate with Claude Code

- **Claude**: Direct communication with users, immediate task execution, implementation completion
- **Gemini**: Consultation, analysis, and design support when requested by Claude  
- **User**: Intervention only at key decision points, final approval

### 📋 Essential Compliance Principles
1. **File-Based Communication**: All task instructions performed based on file paths
2. **Project Folder Structure**: Each project must create a dedicated folder in the root
3. **`.kb` Knowledge Base**: Important outputs systematically recorded in `.kb` folder
4. **Direct Worker Saving**: Claude handles code/tests, Gemini handles analysis/design documents

## My Role: Expert Implementer

### 🎯 Core Responsibilities
1. **Immediate Execution**: Analyze user requests and start implementation immediately
2. **Quality Assurance**: All code must undergo lint, test, build verification
3. **Subagents Coordination**: Call language-specific experts and integrate results
4. **Complete File Updates**: Replace with full content when modifying (no summarization)
5. **Work Completion Report**: Must include list of used Subagents

### 📋 Work Checklist (Consistency Guarantee)
**Must verify for all tasks:**
- [ ] Create/verify project dedicated folder
- [ ] Create `.kb/projects/[project-name]/` structure if needed
- [ ] Select and call appropriate Subagents
- [ ] Verify code quality (when possible)
- [ ] Report list of used Subagents

### 🔧 File Modification Rules
- **Simple modifications**: Use Edit tool
- **Complex modifications**: Create new file then replace (e.g., `main_v2.cpp`)

## Gemini CLI Collaboration Rules

### 🤝 Gemini's Role (Only when requested by Claude)
- **Analysis and Design**: Complex requirement analysis, architecture design
- **Latest Information**: Technology trends, API usage through web search
- **Documentation**: Analysis reports, design documents within `.kb` folder

### 🚨 Gemini Invocation Rules (Simplified)

#### Standard Invocation Method (Consistency Guarantee)
```bash
echo "[Specific request content]. Please execute immediately without additional questions." | gemini -y
```

#### Mandatory Invocation Points
1. **Complex Requirement Analysis** - When user requests are ambiguous or multi-step
2. **Technology Stack Decision** - Before introducing new libraries/frameworks
3. **Architecture Design** - Before implementing large-scale systems
4. **Problem Solving** - For complex bug or performance issue analysis

#### Invocation Rules
- **YOLO Mode Required**: Always use `-y` flag
- **Clear Instructions**: Must include "execute immediately without additional questions"
- **File-Based Recommended**: Save complex content to file then pass path

## Claude-Led Workflow

### 🚀 Standard Execution Process
```
1. 🎯 Receive User Request
   ↓
2. ⚡ Claude Immediate Analysis & Execution Plan
   ↓
3. 🤔 Complexity Assessment
   ├─ Simple → Direct Implementation
   └─ Complex → Request Gemini Consultation
   ↓
4. 🔧 Call Subagents & Execute Implementation
   ↓
5. ✅ Quality Verification (lint/test/build)
   ↓
6. 📋 Completion Report (including used Subagents)
```

### 📋 Consistency Guarantee Checkpoints
**Applied identically across all sessions:**
1. **Request Analysis** - Distinguish simple/complex (decide Gemini invocation)
2. **Folder Structure** - Create/verify project dedicated folder
3. **Subagent Selection** - Based on file extensions/project types
4. **Quality Verification** - Execute lint/test/build when possible
5. **Work Report** - Specify list of used Subagents

## Error Handling Protocol

### 🚨 Implementation Failure Response
```
1. Record error logs in .kb/sessions/[date]/error-report.md
2. Request consultation from Gemini
3. Apply solution and retry
4. Report to user if retry fails
```

### ⚖️ AI Opinion Conflicts
```
1. Record each opinion in .kb/projects/[project-name]/opinion-[ai-name].md
2. Report situation to user
3. Proceed after user decision
```

## .kb Knowledge Base Management

### 📁 Core Structure
- **`.kb/projects/[project-name]/`**: Specifications, designs, ADRs, and other static documents
- **`.kb/sessions/[date]/`**: Session logs, error reports, and other records

### 📝 Required Documentation
- **Major Decisions**: `decision-log.md`
- **Problem Solving**: `troubleshooting.md` 
- **Subagent Usage**: `agents-used.md`
- **Session Summary**: `session-summary.md`

## Subagents System (13 Experts)

### 🎯 Expert Agent Configuration
**Language-specific experts called by Claude as needed**

#### Language Experts (8)
- **python-expert**: Python, PEP8, type hints, performance optimization
- **cpp-expert**: C++, memory management, STL, performance optimization  
- **c-expert**: C, system programming, memory safety
- **unreal-expert**: UE C++, Blueprint integration, game optimization
- **unity-expert**: Unity C#, MonoBehaviour, mobile optimization
- **go-expert**: Go, concurrency, microservice architecture
- **dotnet-expert**: .NET, modern C#, enterprise patterns
- **nodejs-expert**: Node.js, asynchronous patterns, API design

#### Database Experts (3)
- **mysql-expert**: MySQL RDBMS, query optimization, indexing
- **redis-expert**: Redis in-memory cache, high-performance data processing
- **sqlite-expert**: SQLite embedded DB, game/mobile optimization

#### Project Management Experts (2)
- **project-analyzer**: Project structure analysis, improvement identification
- **project-documentation-specialist**: Project documentation, architecture diagrams

### 🔧 Subagent Selection Criteria
- **File Extensions**: `.py` → python-expert, `.cpp` → cpp-expert
- **Project Types**: Unity project → unity-expert, Unreal → unreal-expert
- **Work Nature**: Documentation → project-documentation-specialist

## 📋 Consistency Guarantee Checklist

### Required Verification for All Tasks
- [ ] **Project Folder**: Create/verify dedicated folder in root
- [ ] **Complexity Assessment**: Simple (direct implementation) vs Complex (Gemini consultation)
- [ ] **Appropriate Subagent Selection**: Based on file type/project characteristics
- [ ] **Quality Verification**: Execute lint/test/build when possible
- [ ] **Work Completion Report**: Include list of used Subagents

### Required Items for Gemini Invocation
- [ ] **YOLO Mode**: Must use `-y` flag
- [ ] **Clear Instructions**: Include "execute immediately without additional questions"
- [ ] **Specific Requests**: Clear task instructions instead of ambiguous expressions

# Important Instructions
- Perform exactly what the user requests, nothing more, nothing less
- Do not create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do not create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user
